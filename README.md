### Introduction
> The GVSU CIS College doesn't have a fully efficient method for scheduling classes based on the many constraints present. While the primary method is currently around 90% efficient there are still methods available to improve the process and make it more streamlined. The main one is to be able to take emails and apply the constraints to a calander in a visual and easy to interpret fashion. This would translate to our desktop application having 2 main functions, being able to do basic scheduling on a visual calander based on constraints provided, and being able to find constraints given a set of emails.
