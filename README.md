### 1 Abstract
The primary goal of this project is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of taking in all of the data that comes with scheduling 47 professors for classes in the GVSU College of Computing. 

The process is already to the point where the first 90% of the schedule is quick and effective and has little current need for change. Yet the last 10% is where the vast majority of the time is spent resolving teaching conflicts, course requirements, overload requests, and other finalizing tasks. 

Our specific solution is twofold 
1) Provide a better visual representation of the schedule to allow for information to be displayed more clearly allowing for better decision making 
2) Give suggestions when attempting to fill in a schedule. Giving a list of suggestions takes a lot of manual labor searching an entire database out of the equation

The scope of the project will be determined as it is developed, as the sheer quantity of improvements to a system like this is outside of the scope of this project. For example there could be automatic detection of double booked classrooms, teaching conflicts, credit hour needs unmet, ect. The current overall goal however is to create a web app that can supplement some parts of the schedule creating process.
